# Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding article on freeCodeCamp. 

This is what I made by learning from FreeCode(Youtube). Tried to make exactly same.

Setup:
- move a copy of .env.sample to .env and paste your API-key
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server
